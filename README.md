This repository has been reset to a minimal state so it can be safely deleted or rebuilt from scratch.

## What was done
- Removed all previous project files from version control.
- Added a `.gitignore` to prevent temporary files (like `node_modules`) from being committed again.

If you need to remove the repository entirely on GitHub, you can now do so without leftover tracked files getting in the way.
